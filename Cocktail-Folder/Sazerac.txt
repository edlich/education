Ingredients
Absinthe, to rinse
1 sugar cube
1/2 teaspoon cold water
5 dashes Peychaud’s bitters
2 1/2 ounces rye whiskey
Garnish: lemon peel


Steps:

Rinse a chilled rocks glass with absinthe, discarding any excess, and set aside.

In a mixing glass, muddle the sugar cube, water and the Peychaud’s bitters.

Add the rye whiskey, fill the mixing glass with ice and stir 15­–20 seconds, until well-chilled.

Strain into the prepared glass.

Twist the lemon peel over the drink’s surface to express the peel’s oils, then garnish with the peel.
