These file is for the bottles of wine. 

99 bottles of wine on the wall, 99 bottles of wine.
If one of them should happen to fall we have 98 bottles of wine on the wall.

98 bottles of wine on the wall, 98 bottles of wine.
Fill your glass and pass it around, 97 bottles of wine on the wall.

Later on everyone will be drunk!
But who is going to be the driver?
