Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.[1] Its current maintainer since 2005 is Junio Hamano.

Explaining the unusual name choice for his project, Torvalds said: "I’m an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First ‘Linux’, now ‘Git’." [2]
