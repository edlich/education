#### Simple Guidelines

HTTP status codes can be roughly summarized into 5 categories.
Codes starting with 100 are "Information". Codes that start with 200 usually mean that everything is "Ok". Codes starting with 300 often indicate a redirect. Codes starting with 400 often indicate a problem with the client, while codes starting with 500 may indicate a problem with the server.
