# Project based learning #

Learning several modern techniques in a short period of time is a challenging task. 
If students have only a few hours to learn new tools or technologies, 
the learning results are quite small. Working in teams and distributing 
the load on expert teams (topic owners) may increase the overall learning effect, 
performance and motivation. Combined with agile project management methods, 
the course may further get a methodical learning effect.

* All students in the course form the project team.
* Aim of the project: A small run capable tool
* Small (fixed) teams of 2-3 students
* Rotating roles: Teams are fixed, but their roles change every week (Dev -> QA -> 
Doc)
* One topic per week (Testing, Continuous Delivery, AOP, DVCS, ...)
* One week time boxes
* Weekly web-meetings as plannings/retrospectives
* Team-based stand-ups
* Team-based code-ownership - Learn how to work as a team, handle interfaces, merge 
conflicts, ...
