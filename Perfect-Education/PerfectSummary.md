**Writing summaries for Guest Lectures.**

Writing a summary is an important academic skill. The strict word limit
of a summary makes it necessary to make selections and decisions which
require a thorough knowledge and understanding of the topic at hand:
Only the most important and relevant aspects of the talk will be
represented in the summary, and the summary\'s author first has to
identify those. As a consequence, it requires more reflection and a
deeper understanding to write 200 words than to write 1000.

In addition, the length constraint forces the author to think carefully
about the words used and the grammatical structures employed.
Unreflected writing wastes words and makes it difficult to complete the
task effectively.

> **BEFORE STARTING TO WRITE THE SUMMARY:**

-   **Step 1.** Write a one-sentence description of the entire talk for
    yourself. What was the topic, what was the conclusion of the talk?

-   **Step 2.** Structure the talk into sections (ideally between three
    and five). Describe the content of each of the sections in one
    sentence for yourself.

-   **Step 3.** Give a one-sentence description of the argumentative
    structure of the talk (the \"red thread\").

-   **Step 4.** For each of the sections you identified in **Step 2**,
    give a one-sentence description of how they fit into the
    argumentative structure described in **Step 3**.

-   **Step 5.** For each of the sections you identified in **Step 2**,
    list all of the subtheses and claims made in the talk. (This will in
    general be much more than 200 words.)

-   **Step 6.** Identify those subtheses and claims that are most
    relevant for the overall argumentative structure.

> **WRITING A DRAFT OF THE SUMMARY:**

-   **Step 7.** Your summary should start with a one-sentence thesis
    statement with (a) the topic and subject matter of the text and (b)
    the speaker\'s main conclusion(s). This sentence will be a synthesis
    of the sentences you wrote down in **Step 1** and **Step 3**.

-   **Step 8.** After that, describe the speaker\'s line of argument
    towards the main conclusions, following the \"red thread\"
    identified in **Step 3**. Mention the most important supporting
    argument as identified in **Step 6**.

-   A summary does not contain your personal opinions or conclusions.

> **STYLISTIC ISSUES:**

-   The intended audience of the summary is a (fictitious) student from
    our class who did not go to the guest lecture. You may assume that
    the reader has a general knowledge about logic, but nothing that was
    specifically introduced in the talk can be taken for granted.

-   Make sure that the argumentative structure of your text is clear and
    that a reader understands what you are writing. For each single
    sentence, ask yourself \"Why is it there?\", \"What does it add to
    the summary?\", \"Does it connect to the previous sentence?\".
    Useful words and phrases for this are \"in addition\", \"moreover\",
    \"on the other hand\", \"however\", \"finally\", \"whereas\". If you
    don\'t know what \"coordination/subordination\" (FANBOYS) means, try
    to [[find
    out.]{.ul}](http://www.google.nl/search?hl=nl&q=fanboys+coordination&btnG=Zoeken) Also
    follow the usual stylistic rules of (a) avoiding the passive voice
    if possible and (b) using positive statements instead of negative
    statements.

-   While none of the sentences should stand isolated, you should on the
    other hand be cautious with inferential connectives: if you write
    \"because\", \"thus\", \"therefore\", ask yourself whether this is
    warranted. Does the reader understand why this is a consequence, or
    would that need additional information that you didn\'t include?

-   **Step 9.** In most cases, the draft produced in **Step 8** will be
    longer than 200 words. In order to reduce the number of words,
    eliminate all unnecessary words and repetitions. Combine sentences,
    remove adjectives and adverbs unless they contribute to the content.

> *Example 1.* \"To argue his point, Smith gave a very detailed example
> of Shakespeare\'s characteristic humour. In this example, he stressed
> particularly the effect of wordplay and allusion.\" (26 words) \-\--
> \"To argue his point, Smith gave an example of Shakespeare\'s humour
> stressing the effect of wordplay and allusion.\" (18 words)
>
> *Example 2.* \"There were many completely innovative proposals that
> were submitted to the committee.\" (12 words) \-\-- \"The committee
> reviewed many innovative designs.\" (6 words)
>
> *Example 3.* \"It is clearly the case that the information-based
> economy demands employees who know how to learn logic applications.\"
> (19 words) \-\-- \"The new information-based economy demands employees
> who can learn logic applications.\" (12 words)
>
> *Example 4.* \"The report of the committee was comprised of a list of
> essential skills needed by graduates of the Logic Programme.\" (21
> words) \-\-- \"The committee\'s report listed essential skills for the
> Logic Programme graduates.\" (11 words)
>
> **BEFORE SUBMITTING THE SUMMARY:**

-   **Step 10.** Give the summary to a third person and ask them to
    check whether they understand what you want to communicate.

-   **Step 11.** Make necessary changes, proofread spelling and grammar
    thoroughly, and hand in.
