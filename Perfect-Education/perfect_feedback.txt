The Perfect Feedback (Sascha Lorenz, online Medieninformatik (Master))

- The perfect feedback for exercises should be honest and objective
- It should contain good points, less good points and suggestions for improvement
- It should be transparent and comparable
- It should arrive contemporary to still be close to the topic
- It should be motivating instead of being destructive
- Feedbacks have to be given by experts
